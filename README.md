 # Responsiveness Assignment

### Overview

In this assignment, you'll create two different portfolios. The first will be building
your portfolio layout using the Bootstrap CSS Framework. The second will be enhancing
the portfolio you made last unit with a mobile-responsive layout.

### Before You Begin

* If you opted to do the wireframe (easier) assignment for last homework or if you struggled with the portfolio design, ask a member of the instructional staff to provide you with the solution files. This will provide a starting point for the current assignment. 

* You've learned a ton of material: HTML, CSS, GitHub, GitHub Pages, and Bootstrap. If you feel like you're falling behind, there's no need to panic. You'll have plenty of time to digest and master this material.

* We're diving into JavaScript next unit, and HTML/CSS will start receiving less focus. Still, you'll find that a basic knowledge of HTML/CSS will help you understand JavaScript, especially when we use it to manipulate web pages.

### Submission on BCS

* Please submit both the deployed Github.io link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!

### Instructions

# Bootstrap-Portfolio

- Create a new GitHub repositories and name them `Bootstrap-Portfolio`.

- Clone these repositories to your computer.

### Assignment One Instructions (Bootstrap)

1. Inside your `Bootstrap-Portfolio` repo, create `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

2. Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout (remember the grid, rows and columns are your friends)

     * eg. On `xs` and `sm` screens, content should take up the entire screen. On `md` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right side of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device versus your computer to see this in action!

   * Responsive images

   **BONUS**
   Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site _(Hint: Check out the Bootstrap documentation)_

3. Your Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.

4. Deploy your new Bootstrap-powered portfolio to GitHub Pages.



9. **Protip**: Use the Chrome extensions [Window Resizer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/window-resizer/kkelicaakdanhinjdeammmilcgefonfh) and [Browser Width](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/browser-width/mlnegepkjlccabakompdmbcmdieaideh) to see the browser dimensions in Chrome.

10. Deploy your new portfolio (now with media queries!) to GitHub Pages.

### Submitting Your Work on [BootCampSpot](https://www.bootcampspot-v2.com/)

1. Submit the GitHub links to your portfolio repositories on GitHub.

2. Submit the link to your (GitHub Pages) deployed site in the same input field.

### BONUS

* Incorporate CSS animations in your portfolio. [More info here](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp).

### Reminder: Submission on BCS

* Please submit both the deployed Github.io link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!
